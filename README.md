- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://phillipdaum.github.io/social-links-profile-main/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the CSS `@font-face` rule!

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  src: url(assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slntwght.ttf) format("truetype"),
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This helped me for because MDN tends to be very thorough. 
- [W3 Schools @font-face](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_font-face.php) - This was helpful because MDN can be a little dense for starters and sometimes W3 is a better starting point.
